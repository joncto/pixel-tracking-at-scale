# Pixel Tracking at Scale

This small repo contains the code for creating a large image, consisting of millions of tracking pixels found in the Norwegian Web Archive. The objective is to visualise the extent to which web services have been tracking people's behaviour online since the turn of the millenia.

The code allows one to:
- parse WARC payloads to image files
- analyse the colour of the images
- assemble a large number of one-pixel images into one big image
